_Verse 1_

I’ve tried, tried, tried  
And I’ve tried even more  
I’ve Cried, Cried, Cried  
And I can’t recall what for  
I’ve pressed, I’ve pushed, I’ve yelled, I’ve begged  
In hope of some success  
But the inevitable fact is that  
It never will impress  

_Chorus 1_

I’ve no more fucks to give,  
My fucks have runneth dry,
