_Verse 1_

I’ve tried, tried, tried  
And I’ve tried even more  
I’ve Cried, Cried, Cried  
And I can’t recall what for  
I’ve pressed, I’ve pushed, I’ve yelled, I’ve begged  
In hope of some success  
But the inevitable fact is that  
It never will impress  

_Chorus 1_

I’ve no more fucks to give,  
My fucks have runneth dry,  
I’ve tried to go fuck shopping  
But there’s no fucks left to buy  
I’ve no more fucks to give,  
Though more fucks I’ve tried to get,  
I’m over my fuck budget and  
I’m now in fucking debt  

_Verse 2_

I strive, strive, strive  
To get everything done  
I’ve played by all the rules  
But I’ve very rarely won,  
I’ve smiled, I’ve charmed, I’ve wooed  
I’ve laughed,  
Alas to no avail  
I’ve run round like a moron,  
To unequivocally fail!  

_Chorus 2_

I’ve no more fucks to give,  
My fuck fuse has just blown,  
I’ve been hunting for my fucks all day,  
But they’ve upped and fucked off home,  
I’ve no more fucks to give,  
My fuck rations are depleted,
